# Combining Orders on a Whse. Shipment

The Warehouse Shipment document also supports the ability to combine multiple source documents, such as Sales Orders, onto a single warehouse document for operating as a batch. When the Warehouse Shipment is posted, this will update all of the included source document lines. This allows for greater efficiency, as both the Warehouse Shipment and the Warehouse Pick document will combine orders into one Warehouse operation.
