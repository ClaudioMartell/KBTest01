# Shipping a Single Order with Whse. Shipment
The process of Shipping a single Sales Order using the Warehousing module is similar to the Inventory Pick process:

1. Release the Sales Order to indicate the document is ready for handling
2. Either:
   1. Create the Warehouse Shipment from the Sales Order directly
   2. Create the Warehouse Shipment, then use the Get Source Documents
   functionality to pick up the Sales Order

## Scenario 
Use Sales Order __; the Logistics team will ship the items by creating a Warehouse Shipment and adding the Item from the Sales Order.

## Steps
### Prepare the Sales Document
When Sales is ready to hand the **Sales  Order** Document to the Logistics team, they must **Release** the Sales Order for these next steps.

1. Release the Sales Order __.
