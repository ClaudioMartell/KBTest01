# Receiving & Put-Away with Bin Defaults

Assigning default bins to your items can make the process of shipping, receiving, and moving your items much easier. When a default bin is assigned to an item, this bin is suggested every time you initiate a transaction for this item.

## Scenario 
The Logistics team has a new item WRB-1001 theyâ€™re planning for in the Warehouse.  They will set up the default bin for the item, then receive the first purchase order for it.

## Steps

### Assign the Default Bin

1. Using the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do")  icon, enter **Items** and choose the related link.

3. Choose the **Bin Content** action.

    | Location Code | WHITE |
    |--|--|
    | Bin Code | W-02-0003 |
    | Default | Enabled |
    | Unit of measure Code | PCS |

### Prepare the Purchase Documents 
When Purchasing is ready to hand the **Purchase Order** documents to the Logistics team, they must **Release** the purchase orders for these next steps.

### Create the Warehouse Receipt
In this scenario, the Logistics team is creating a warehouse receipt for multiple incoming purchase orders, so they will create the warehouse Receipt, then select the purchase orders wanted.

    3. The lines will contain a new entry for each purchase order line.
    4. The bin code for the lines will be the receiving bin, as configured on the location card, which will be **W08-0001**

### Post the Warehouse Receipt
When the Logistics team has received the items, the warehouse receipt should be updated (with **Qty. to Receive**) and Posted.

1. Update the document

3. Confirm the **Receive** option.

### Register the Warehouse Put-Away
Once the Logistics team has processed the incoming items however necessary, they need to make the items available by putting them away.

> [!NOTE]
