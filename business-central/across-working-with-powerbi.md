# Work with Power BI reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]

In this article, you learn some of the basics about working with reports. Learn about viewing Power BI reports inside [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] (including scorecards and dashboards) and editing Power BI reports that use [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] as a data source. The article discusses some aspects that help you get started as a [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] user. For general guidelines and instructions about using Power BI, see [Power BI documentation for consumers](/power-bi/consumer).

## Overview

Power BI reports give you insight into your [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Various pages in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] include a Power BI reports part that can display Power BI reports. The role center is a typical page where you find a Power BI reports part. Some list pages, like **Items**, also include a Power BI part.

[!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] works together with the Power BI service. Reports for displaying in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] are stored in a Power BI service. In [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you can switch the report displayed in the Power BI part to any Power BI report available in your Power BI service. The first time you sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and until you connect to a Power BI service, parts are empty, as shown here:

## Get started

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online is already set up to integrate with Power BI.

### Sign up Power BI

Before you can use Power BI with [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], you need to sign up for the Power BI service. If you didn't already sign up, go to [https://powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). When you sign up, use your work email address and password.

Once you have a Power BI account, you can sign in at [https://powerbi.microsoft.com/](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/). Learn more in [Sign in to the Power BI service](/power-bi/consumer/end-user-sign-in). 

The Power BI service hosts all the reports available to you. To see a report in your personal workspace, select **My Workspace** > **Reports**. Then just select the report that you want to view. If you have access to one or more shared Power BI workspaces, you can also see reports in those workspaces.

With [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you automatically get a set of default reports on your workspace. If you want to create your own reports, you can use Power BI Desktop to create reports, and then publish them to your workspace. Learn more in [Getting Started Building Reports in Power BI Desktop to Display [!INCLUDE [prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] Data](across-how-use-financials-data-source-powerbi.md).

[!INCLUDE[note-multicompany-reports](includes/note-multicompany-reports.md)]

## <a name="connect"></a>Connect to Power BI - one time only

When you first sign into [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], an empty Power BI part (as shown in the previous figure) is most likely available on various pages. The first thing to do is to connect to your Power BI account. Once connected, you can see reports. You only have to do this step once.

1. Select the **Get Started with Power BI** link in the **Power BI Reports** part.
2. The **Set Up Power BI Reports in Business Central** assisted setup starts. Select **Next** to continue.
3. On the **Check your Power BI License** page, do one of the following steps:

    - If you didn't sign up for Power BI yet, select the [Go to Power BI homepage](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). Sign up for an account, then come back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] and finish the setup.

    - If you already have a license, select **Next**.
4. In the next page, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] will now upload a demo report to Power BI. This step takes a few minutes, so it runs in the background. To complete the setup, select **Next**, then **Finish**.

The connection process starts. During the process, [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] communicates with the Power BI service to determine if you have a valid Power BI account and license. Once your license is verified, the default Power BI report displays on the page. If there a report isn't shown, you can select a report from the part.

> [!TIP]
> With [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, this step automatically uploads default Power BI reports used in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] to your Power BI workspace.

<!--#### From [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises

Connecting to Power BI from [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is similar to online. However, you might be prompted on the **MICROSOFT ENTRA SERVICE PERMISSIONS** page to grant access to Power BI Services. To grant access, select **Authorize Azure Services**, and then **Accept**.

Once connected, you can select a report from the Power BI part on pages.-->

## Work with Power BI reports

### Get the latest data

Each Power BI report is based on a dataset that gets data from the [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] sources. You want to make sure that the data in your Power BI reports is up to date with the data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. This concept is referred to as *refreshing*.  Depending on how your organization set up Power BI, refreshing might not happen automatically. There are two ways to refresh data: manually or by scheduling a refresh. Manual refreshing is done on-demand, as needed. Scheduled refreshing lets you refresh automatically at defined time intervals.

#### Refresh manually

From Power BI online, in the navigation pane, under **Datasets**, select **More options (...)** next to the dataset, then select **Refresh now**.

#### Schedule a refresh

From Power BI online, in the navigation pane, under Datasets, select More options (...) next to the dataset, then select **Schedule refresh**. Fill in the information under the **Schedule refresh** section, and select **Apply**.

Learn more in [Configure scheduled refresh](/power-bi/connect-data/refresh-scheduled-refresh)

### Show reports on list pages

[!INCLUDE[prod_long](includes/prod_long.md)] includes a Power BI FactBox on several key list pages. This FactBox provides extra insight into the data in the list. As you move between rows in the list, the report is updated and filtered for the selected entry.

To learn how to create reports for list pages, see [Creating Power BI Reports for Displaying List Data in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]](across-how-use-powerbi-reports-factbox.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see the Power BI FactBox, it might be hidden on your workspace by personalization. Select the ![Settings.](media/ui-experience/settings_icon_small.png "Settings icon for role center") icon, and then select **Personalize** action. Learn more in [Personalize Your Workspace](ui-personalization-user.md).
>
> Or if you have an older version of Business Central, go to the action bar, select **Actions** > **Display** > **Show/Hide Power BI Reports**.

### Switch reports

A Power BI part on a page can display any Power BI report that's available to you. To switch to view another report, choose the **Select Report** action from the drop-down command list at the top of the part.  

The **Power BI Reports Selection** page shows a list of all the Power BI reports that you have access to. This list is retrieved from any of your own workspaces or workspaces that others shared with you in the Power BI service. Select the **Enable** box for each report that you want to display on the page, and then choose **OK**. You return to the page, and the last report you enabled appears. Using the drop-down command list, use the **Previous** and **Next** commands to navigate between reports.  

### Get more reports

If you don't see any reports on the **Power BI Reports Selection** page, or don't see the report you want, choose **Get Reports**. This action lets you look for reports from two locations: *My Organization* or from *Services*.

- Select **My Organization** to go to the Power BI services. From here, you can view the reports within your organization that you have rights to view. You can then add them to your workspace.
- Select **Services** to go to Microsoft AppSource where you can install Power BI apps.  

> [!TIP]
> If you have Power BI Desktop, you can also create new Power BI reports. Then, once those reports are published to your Power BI workspace, they appear on the **Power BI Reports Selection** page.  

### Manage and modify reports

You can make changes to a report in the Power BI part. The changes that you make are then published to the Power BI service. If the report is shared with other users, they'll also see the changes, unless you save the changes to a new report.

To modify a report, choose the **Manage Report** action from the drop-down command list in the Power BI part. Then start making changes. Once you finish making changes, select **File** > **Save**. If it's a shared report, and you don't want to make the change for all users, select **Save As** to avoid making this change for all users.

When you return to the role center, the updated report appears. If you used **Save As**, you have to choose **Select Report**, and then enable the new report to see it.

> [!NOTE]
> This capability isn't available with [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] on-premises.

### <a name="upload"></a>Upload reports

Power BI Reports can be distributed among users as .pbix files. If you have any .pbix files, you can upload and share them with all users of [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. The reports are shared within each company in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)].  

To upload a report, select the **Upload Report** action from the drop-down command list on the **Power BI Reports** part. Then, locate the .pbix file that defines the reports that you want to share. You can change the default name of the file.  

After the report uploads to your Power BI workspace, it automatically uploads to other users' Power BI workspaces.

> [!NOTE]
> Uploading a report through [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] requires that you have SUPER user permissions in [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. You don't need any special permission to upload reports to your workspace through the Power BI service.

## <a name="upload"></a>Upload reports from files

Power BI Reports can be distributed among users as .pbix files. If you have a .pbix file, you can upload the file to a workspace. To upload a report, do the following steps:

1. In your new workspace, select **Get Data**.
1. In the Files box, select **Get**.

3. Select **Local File**, navigate to where you saved the file, and select **Open**.

Learn more in [Upload the report to the service](/power-bi/paginated-reports/paginated-reports-quickstart-aw#upload-the-report-to-the-service).

<!--
> [!NOTE]
> Uploading a report requires that you have a [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is) work space. Learn more in [Managing Premium capacities](/power-bi/admin/service-premium-capacity-manage). -->

> [!TIP]
> If you're using [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can also upload a report from within [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)]. Learn more in [Work with Power BI Reports in [!INCLUDE [prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] - Upload Reports](across-working-with-powerbi.md#upload).

## <a name="share"></a>Share reports with others

Once a report is in your workspace, you can share it with others in your organization.

To share a report, in a list reports, or in an open report, select **Share**. In the **Share report** pane, enter the full email addresses for individuals or distribution groups you want to share with. Follow the instructions on screen to complete the sharing. Learn more in [Share a dashboard or report](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards#share-a-dashboard-or-report).

> [!NOTE]
> Sharing requires that both you and the people you're sharing the report with have [Power BI Pro license](/power-bi/service-features-license-type). Otherwise, the content must be in [Premium capacity](/power-bi/service-premium-what-is). Learn more in [Ways to share your work in Power BI](/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports).

## Fixing problems

However, if something goes wrong, this section provides a workaround for the most typical issues.  

### You don't have a Power BI account

A Power BI account isn't set up for you. To get a valid Power BI account, you must have a license, and you must have previously signed into Power BI to create a Power BI workspace.

### Message: There are no enabled reports. Choose Select Report to see a list of reports that you can display.

This message appears if the default report failed to deploy to your Power BI workspace. Or it deployed but didn't refresh successfully. Navigate to the report in your Power BI workspace, select **Dataset**, **Settings**, and then manually update the credentials. Once the dataset successfully refreshes, navigate back to [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)], and manually select the report from the **Select Reports** page.

#### You can't see a report on the Select Report page on a list page

It's probably because the report's name doesn't contain the name of the list page. Clear the filter to get a full list of Power BI reports available.
