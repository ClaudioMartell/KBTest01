# How Costing Methods Impact the Item Unit Cost Card

The unit cost for items can be calculated in different ways according to how the **Costing Method** was defined in the [Company Setup](setup-best-practices-costing-method.md) or in the item card. The costing method determines whether an actual or a budgeted value is used in the cost calculation.

As a rule, with costing method set as Standard, the **Unit Cost** field value is based on the standard cost for the item. The option also sets the field in the item table non-editable.

If the costing method is FIFO, LIFO, Specific, or Average, than the unit cost is calculated as follows:

* Unit cost = inventory value of available items (expected cost + invoiced cost) / quantity on hand

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change a costing method for an item after you have included the item in a transaction. For solutions on how to fix an incorrect costing method assigned to an item, see [Design Details: Changing the Costing Method for Items](design-details-changing-costing-methods.md).

## Available costing methods

|Costing method |Description |
|---------------|------------|
|Standard |The item's unit cost is preset. |
|FIFO |An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the FIFO rule. |
|LIFO |An item's unit cost is the actual value of any receipt of the item, selected by the LIFO rule. |
|Average |An item's unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase. |
|Specific |An item's unit cost is the exact cost at which the particular unit was received. |

For more information, see [About Inventory Costing](finance-learn-about-costing.md).

## When is the unit cost field updated

The selected costing method also influences when the item cost is updated.

When the costing method is set as Standard, the **Unit Cost** field is updated whenever the standard cost is changed. For more information, see [Updating Standard Costs](finance-how-to-update-standard-costs.md).

If the costing method is FIFO, LIFO, Specific, or Average, then the **Unit Cost** is updated in the following cases:

* When the item is cost-adjusted, automatically or by an [Adjust Cost](inventory-how-adjust-item-costs.md#to-adjust-item-costs-manually) task.
* During the posting of purchase invoices, output, or positive adjustment if one of the following conditions is true:
  * The net invoiced quantity of the item changes from negative or zero to positive.
  * The current unit cost is zero.

If one of these conditions is true, then the **Unit Cost** field is updated with the value in the **Last Direct Cost** field on the item card.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Unit Cost** field is not updated if the current unit cost is higher than zero and the new unit cost is zero. A unit cost of zero is considered an exception from regular business. Therefore, the current unit cost is retained to provide the last known, relevant value. This exception applies even if the existing inventory has been revalued to zero.

If you use the Average costing method, then an itemâ€™s unit cost is calculated as the average unit cost at each point in time after a purchase. Inventory is valuated with the assumption that all inventories are sold simultaneously. For items that use this costing method, you can choose the **Unit Cost** field on the item card to view the history of transactions that the average cost is calculated from in the **Average Cost Calc. Overview** window.
