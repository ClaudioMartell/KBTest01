# Electronic invoicing in New Zealand

This article provides information on how to work with the New Zealand localization of the E-Document framework.

## E-Documents framework setup 

Read detailed information on how to set up the E-Documents framework [here](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).  

### Set up local formats  

> [!NOTE]
> The E-Document framework for the New Zealand localization supports only the Peppol PINT A-NZ format. 

To set up the format for the E-Document service, follow these steps:  

1. Select the ![Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **E-Document Services**, and then select the related link. The **E-Document Services** page displays. 
2. On the **General** FastTab, select **New**. In the **Document Format** field, choose **PINT A-NZ**.  
3. Configure the fields as described in [Set up e-documents](../../finance-how-setup-edocuments.md).   
4. In the **Service Integration** field, you can select any service provider available for the New Zealand market with whom you have an agreement.  
5. Close the page.  

## Working with E-invoices
