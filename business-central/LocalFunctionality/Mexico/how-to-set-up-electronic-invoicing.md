# Set up Electronic invoicing - Mexico

Before you can send electronic documents, you must set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to ensure that the tax identification number (RFC), personal identification number (CURP), and state inscription IDs are available for your company and all your customers and vendors. You also need to set up the parameters that are needed for sending electronic invoices to customers and vendors. These parameters include the certificate thumbprint, which is the certificate that you received from the Mexico tax authority (SAT).  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The certificate that you received from the Mexico tax authority must be installed for each user who sends electronic invoices. For more information, see the [Servicio de Administracíon Tributaria](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=242772) website.  
>
> Your company must also have SMTP mail set up for emailing electronic invoices. Depending on the configuration in your company, you may need to grant explicit SMTP permissions to each relevant user and computer. The documents will be sent from the address that is specified on the **Company Information** page.
