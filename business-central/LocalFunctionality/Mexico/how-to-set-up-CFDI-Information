# Set Up CFDI Information

Before you can send electronic documents, you must set up [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] to ensure that the right tax catalogues are in the right place. This content is required by the PAC and the Mexico tax authority (SAT).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The right catalogues should be set up in order for the PAC to stamp you without errors. For more information, see the [Servicio de Administrac√≠on Tributaria](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=242772) website.
