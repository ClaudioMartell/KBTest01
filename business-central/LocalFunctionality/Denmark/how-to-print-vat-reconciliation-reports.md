# Print VAT reconciliation reports
In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can use the **VAT Reconciliation** report to view a list of general ledger accounts with their base amounts and VAT amounts. VAT type groups these amounts to help with VAT settlement reconciliation.  

### To print a VAT reconciliation report  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **VAT Reconciliation**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  On the **Options** FastTab, fill in the fields as described in the following table.  

    |Field|Description|  
    |---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  
    |**Show Details**|Select to print all transaction amounts in the report.<br /><br /> If you don't select this field, a single cumulative line is printed for each general ledger account.|  
    |**Show Transactions without VAT**|Select to print a line for each general ledger account that transactions are posted to. You can use this option for both single accounts and multiple accounts.<br /><br /> The default is **No**. The report includes only those transactions that include VAT entries.

3.  On the **G/L Entry** FastTab, select the appropriate filters.
