# Create Electronic Documents by Using OIOUBL

> [!NOTE]
> This feature isn't related to the new E-documents framework and requirments related to the new Danish bookkeeping act. For new functionality and updated OIOUBL 3.0, you can find updated content in **Electronic invoicing with NemHandel**.   

When you sell goods or services to a customer in the public sector, you must submit documents electronically. You can create the following electronic documents: 

* Invoices
* Credit memos
* Reminders
* Finance charge memos

Before you can create the electronic documents though, you must set up your customers for OIOUBL. Learn more at [Set Up Customers for OIOUBL](how-to-set-up-customers-for-oioubl.md).  

You can create an electronic document after you post the sales or service document. The following sections describe how to post a sales invoice with the required information and then create an electronic sales invoice, but the same procedure applies to sales and service credit memos and reminders.  

## To post a sales invoice

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the sales invoice that you want to post.  
3. Make sure that the **External Document No.** field contains the document number that the customer supplied. OIOUBL electronic documents require this number.

    > [!Note]  
    > For service documents, you must fill in the **Your Reference** field.  

4. On the **Invoicing** FastTab, fill in the **GLN** and **OIOUBL Account Code** fields.  

    For reminders and finance charge memos, the fields are on the **Posting** FastTab.  

5. Post the invoice.  

## To create an electronic sales invoice

After you post a document, you can create an electronic invoice in an OIOUBL format. The following steps describe the process for posted sales invoices, but the process is the same for other documents.

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Posted Sales Invoices**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Open the relevant posted sales invoice.  
3. Choose the **Create Electronic <*document type*>** action.  
4. Optionally, in the **Create Electronic <*document type*>** page, set additional filters, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> In the online version of Business Central and the web client for on-premises versions, the XML file is created in your Downloads folder.
