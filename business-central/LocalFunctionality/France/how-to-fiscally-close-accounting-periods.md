# Fiscally Close Accounting Periods
When a fiscal period is complete, you can fiscally close the period to make sure that no more general ledger entries can be posted.  

## To fiscally close accounting periods  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Accounting Periods**, and then choose the relevant link.  
2.  On the **Accounting Periods** page, choose the **Close Fiscal Period** action.  

    If more than one fiscal period is not fiscally closed, the earliest one should be fiscally closed. A message appears to identify the period that should be closed and explains the consequences of closing it.  

3.  To fiscally close the period, choose the **Yes** button.  

When the period is fiscally closed, the Fiscally Closed field is selected, and the Fiscal Closing Date field is updated for the period.
