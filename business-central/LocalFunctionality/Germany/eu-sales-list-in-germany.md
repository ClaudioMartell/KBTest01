# EU Sales List in Germany
In Germany, the German EU sales list is submitted to the "Bundeszentralamt für Steuern" (BZSt) through the BZSt Online Portal by using the ELMA5 interface.  

In order to increase security, all types of taxes and tax reports must be submitted under an authentication method. Beginning in January 1, 2013, it has become mandatory that you make submissions with authentication. To do so, you sign in with your BZSt number and private key using your pass phrase on the ELMA5 communications server. ELMA5 is designed to handle the transmission of large datasets of more than 1000 records. Following successful login, you can upload the data transfer in an interactive way. You can also set up the transfer to be automatic.
