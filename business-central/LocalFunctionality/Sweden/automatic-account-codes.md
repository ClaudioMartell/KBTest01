# Automatic account codes in the Swedish Version

> [!NOTE]
> Automatic account codes are part of the Swedish localization. However, starting in version 22.1, Swedish localization will be based on the W1 base app and the Automatic account codes functionality will be moved to the extension installed by default. There are no functional changes. To learn more, see [Save time with automatic account codes](automatic-account-codes.md).
