# Edit Document Amounts in Purchase Invoices and Credit Memos in the Dutch Version
[!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] lets you easily edit document amounts in purchase invoices and credit memos.  

## To edit document amounts  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Purchase Invoice** or **Purchase Credit Memo**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Edit the document amount in the **Doc. Amount Incl. VAT** field and the **Doc. Amount VAT** field.  

If you use the **Get Recurring Purchase Lines** action to insert lines based on a **Standard Purchase Code**, if the quantity in the first line is 0 or 1 and the unit cost is 0, [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)] compares the amount entered with the calculated total amount and applies the difference to the first line that was inserted.
