# Manually Transfer and Post CODA Statements in the Belgian Version
After you have applied and processed all CODA statement lines, you can manually transfer the CODA statement lines to a financial journal. The financial journal lets you enter a starting balance and an ending balance and automatically calculate the difference between the two balances. Posting is not allowed if the statement line amounts do not balance with the statement ending balance.  

For information about how to automatically transfer statements, see [Automatically Transfer and Post CODA Statements](how-to-automatically-transfer-and-post-coda-statements.md).  

## To manually transfer and post statement lines  

1.  Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **General Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2.  Select the journal, and then choose the **OK** button.  
3.  Enter the **Statement Ending Balance** field.  
4.  Manually enter each line of the statement.  
5.  Choose the **Post** action.
