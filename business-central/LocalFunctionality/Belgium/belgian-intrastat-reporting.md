# Belgian Intrastat Reporting

[!INCLUDE[intrastat-2022w2](../../includes/intrastat-2022w2.md)]

Companies in the European Union (EU) are required to report trade with other countries/regions in the EU. This reporting process is through Intrastat reporting or VIES (VAT Information Exchange System). There are two types of Intrastat declarations:  

- Simplified declaration  
- Extended declaration  

To determine the type of declaration that you should use, visit the [National Bank of Belgium](https://aka.ms/BelgianNationalBank) website.  

## Submitting the Intrastat report

In [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../../includes/prod_short.md)], you can export the Intrastat declarations to a file that you can then submit to the OneGate portal. For more information, see [Export Intrastat Third-Party Declarations](how-to-export-intrastat-third-party-declararations.md).
