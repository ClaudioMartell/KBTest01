# Set the E-Documents connector with external endpoints

This article explains how to set up E-Documents functionality when it's connected to external endpoints.

Before you use the functionality that's described in this article, install the **E-Documents Connector with External Endpoints** app on the top of the global **E-Document Core** app. This app can be used for default integration with the external (third-party) access points to automate the e-document flow. Because this app represents only some of the selected connectors, you aren't limited to existing integrations in it. Most of the connectors will be available on AppSource in the future.

## Set up the connection

Based on the endpoint service provider you chose,, the next steps might be different. You can find details about set up parameters for all available service providers [here](finance-edocuments-connectors.md).

## Set up company information

Before you start using e-documents, update your **Company Information** page by completing the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Company Information**, and then select the related link.
2. In addition to filling in the usual fields, you must also fill in the following fields:

    | Field name | Description |
    |---|---|
    | SWIFT Code | Specify the SWIFT code (international bank identifier code) of your primary bank. |
    | Bank Branch No. | Specify the bank's four-digit branch number. |
    | VAT Registration No. | Specify the company's value-added tax (VAT) registration number. |

3. Close the page.

## Set up customers to receive e-documents

To enable customers to receive your e-documents, complete the following steps:

1. Select the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Customers**, and then select the related link.
2. Open the **Customer** card.
3. In addition to filling in the usual fields, in the **GLN** field, specify the customer in connection with the sending of electronic documents.
4. Mark the **Use GLN in Electronic Documents** field to indicate whether the Global Location Number (GLN) is used as a party identification number in electronic documents.
5. Close the page.

## Other setup

Before you start to work with e-documents, set up the e-document **workflows** and **document sending profiles** to use your workflows. After the service connection is established, you can start to use your e-document solution.

## Available service providers

Microsoft wants to encourage access point providers to add their connectors on top of our **E-Document Core** framework.

Currently, Pagero is the only access point provider that's covered by this system. Microsoft has no contractual obligation with Pagero. Therefore, you must make a contract with them to get all the necessary credentials.

We'll update this list as we get new e-document exchange access point providers.
